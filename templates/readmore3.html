        <h1 class="article_headline">EU Energy Chief Backs German Plan for Price Controls</h1>
   
        <p>
            European Union Energy Commissioner
            Andris Piebalgs  backed German government plans to give antitrust
            authorities powers to challenge energy price increases.
            Germany's Economy Ministry is considering steps to keep
            utilities from charging prices that exceed costs ``excessively''
            after E.ON AG and RWE AG attracted attention for posting record
            earnings while increasing costs for private and business clients.
            ``There's this problem in Germany that there're suspicions
            about too little competition driving electricity prices too
            high,'' Piebalgs said in an interview in Berlin. The German
            antitrust office ``must be enabled to verify this.''
            Utilities in  Europe  are being scrutinized by the European
            Commission and national regulators for shutting out competitors
            and driving up prices. The four largest utilities in  Germany
            generate 80 percent of the country's power and E.ON has more than
            50 percent of the natural-gas market.
            RWE, Germany's second-largest utility, said on Sept. 28 that
            replacing market prices for power with regulated charges would
            curb competition in Europe's largest economy. Regulated prices
            would discourage investors and utilities from building new  power
            plants , according to the company.
            Piebalgs rejected industry complaints, saying the German
            government's plans keep clear of ``fixing prices'' and ``solely
            aim to verify'' whether power companies are overcharging their
            customers.
            ``Why do utilities have to complain about it if it's carried
            out in a transparent and appropriate way,'' said Piebalgs. ``This
            is going in the right direction and I support (Economy) Minister
            Michael Glos's steps in that respect.''
            Oil Prices
            Piebalgs said current oil prices of around $60 per barrel are
            still ``fairly high.'' Still, with supply holding ``stable'' and
            tensions in the  Middle East  abating, oil costs may not pose marked
            swings in either direction, he said.
            ``The oil price will probably continue hovering around the
            $60 level,'' he said. ``I don't believe there will be a distinct
            drop. Supply is stable and conditions aren't particularly tense,
            so I don't see a large increase either.''
            The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last
            week to lower output by 1.2 million barrels a day starting Nov. 1.
            The cut is designed to prop up prices which have fallen by about
            25 percent from the record high they reached in July.
            Turning to Russia, Piebalgs said Europe faces ``a great
            opportunity'' to create stable energy ties with the world's
            largest fuel exporter once the country opens up its electricity
            and gas industries.
            `` Russia 's energy sector needs great investments,'' the
            commissioner said. ``That's where I believe our investment
            opportunities are.''
            Europe and Russia must strive to achieve ``an open investment
            climate'' that bars monopolistic structures, Piebalgs said at a
            press briefing, noting even OAO Gazprom with its monopoly on
            Russia's gas network and exports would then find it ``easier'' to
            foster its business links inside the 25-nation EU.
            ``If there's no such situation, there's the danger of a
            monopolistic situation which we want to avoid,'' he said.
